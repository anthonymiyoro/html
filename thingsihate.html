		<h1>THINGS I HATE</h1>

			<h2>Sites That Require E-Mail Activation</h2>
				<p>Why would you think that your users would want to create another account when they have hundreds of others?Perhaps they would love to be a part of your site forever? </p>

			<h2>Things That Require Battrey Sizes other than AA</h2>
				<p>Why cant they just be the same? Its statisically twice as hard (not really) to get a AAA or God forbid those square ones!</p>

			<h2>Vanilla Ice Cream</h2>
				<p>Just give me water instead</p>

			<h2>When Someone Knocks on a Bathroom Door</h2>
				<p>Its locked for a reason.</p>

			<h2>Tatoos</h2>
				<p>Why would you adorn your body with such hideousness? Why?</p>

			<h2>CBS Online Commercials</h2>
				<p>Enough said</p>
